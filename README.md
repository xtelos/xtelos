## Hey there, I'm Dylan

🚀 Developer by trade, giga-nerd by my own standards

I thrive on tackling **unique and complex** problems that keep most people awake at night. For me, it's the best time to blast some divorced dad rock and just hammer away at a solution.

Currently, I work full-time as an **Applications Developer at Software Consulting Services, LLC**, where I build and maintain production web systems. Outside of that, I’m also the **Co-Owner of Cloud City Computing, LLC**, where I focus on innovating solutions for problems I genuinely care about. The difference between the two is a passion for an industry versus a passion for personal problems I've faced as a developer.

## 🔭 What I’m Into Lately

- Improving developer experience and tooling
  - I've been working with some reactive frameworks like ReactJS, but also learning legacy web frameworks like working in 20 year old PHP applications that just need a little love to get them spruced up again.
- Performance tuning & cleanup of real-world applications
  - I couldn't even tell you how many problems exist in deployed legacy applications that would make your skin crawl. **BUT**, finding them and fixing them is one of the most rewarding things you could ever do as a developer
- Building things that *actually* get used
  - Everyone loves the fun little projects but building something that helps real people is priceless.
