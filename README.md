## 👋 Hey there, I'm Dylan

🚀 Developer by trade, giga-nerd by my own standards.

I thrive on tackling **unique, complex problems**—the kind that keep most people up at night. For me, that’s prime time to throw on some divorced-dad rock and hammer away at a solution until it finally clicks.

I currently work full-time as an **Applications Developer at Software Consulting Services, LLC**, where I build and maintain production web systems. Alongside that, I’m the **Co-Owner of Cloud City Computing, LLC**, where I focus on creating solutions for problems I genuinely care about. The difference between the two is simple: one is passion for an industry, the other is passion born from real problems I’ve faced as a developer.

## 🔭 What I’m Into Lately

- **Developer experience & tooling**  
  Working with modern reactive frameworks like React while also spelunking through 20-year-old PHP applications that just need a little love to shine again.

- **Performance tuning & real-world cleanup**  
  Legacy production systems hide horrors that would make your skin crawl—but finding and fixing them is one of the most rewarding parts of the job.

- **Building things that actually get used**  
  Fun side projects are great, but shipping something that helps real people never gets old.
